# Movie-Ratings

A game using the TMDB (The Movie Database) API.

As a player, you'll be shown two movie posters.
Your job is to guess which of the two earned more money at the box office than the other!

Future implementations include two player mode, score keeping, and a more cooler 'you won' messaging system.
